You can watch the demo of our design here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/17QOLflzjDd_zoCRmfvy6YPpxtyquLg8S/view?usp=share_link


// There is one more directory called "Lib" which we can't able to add but here is the link of it https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UvqVq010p6MVA9xQRRCGjeJ7TCmVewXF?usp=share_link


## Problem Statement & Requirements

1. Based on the teams formed, each team is supposed to create a web application of the proposed functionalities in the previous assignments. Each team can be divided into Group G1 and Group G2; G1 is supposed to work on the front-end and G2 on the back-end sections, respectively. You can use Flask + MySQL for developing your WebApp.

2. The web app should support the dynamic execution (The changes done by the user through the web app shall be reflected in the main database and web page also) of the following functions on your database :
- [ ]  INSERT
- [ ]  UPDATE
- [ ]  DELETE
- [ ]  RENAME
- [ ]  WHERE

3. Push it to GitHub and share the link for submission

4. Login page with authentication of users and stakeholders. 


## Tasks

## Responsibility of G1 :

G1 is supposed to design the front end and beautify accordingly using _HTML/CSS/JS_, you may use any other libraries for the front end, such as _Bootstrap_ or _jQuery_. But flask is mandatory.

## Responsibility of G1 and G2 :

### (a). Web App with Flask and MySQL Integration
This is a web app that integrates Flask and MySQL and allows for dynamic execution of database functions such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, RENAME, and WHERE clause. The app also includes a login page with user authentication.

### Initial Setup
**1.** Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.: git clone **https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git**

**2.** Open a terminal window and navigate to the root folder of the project.

**3.** Create a virtual environment using the command **`python3 -m venv env_flask`**

**4.** Activate the virtual environment using the command **`source env_flask/bin/activate`**

**5.** Install the required packages using the command **`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`**

**6.** Set up your MySQL database and update the **config.yml file** with your database credentials.

You can create a MySQL database named **laundry_db** with the following credentials:
- _Username_ : `root`
- _Password_ : `password`
- _Host_ : `localhost`
- _Port_ : `3306`

**7.** Import the **laundry_db.sql** file into the database to create the required tables and dummy data.

### Running the App
**8.** Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the app by running the following command: **`python app.py`**

**9.** Open a web browser and enter the following URL: **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**  
**[Might be different based on which port you are running the localhost]**

### (b). Screenshots of successful execution of the dynamic operations: 
We are directly show the before and after changes reflected in our concerned table in the web app in this README file.

In login page where clause is used to validate user and to signed in user and store the session of user

```
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Fetch form data
        userDetails = request.form
        password = userDetails['password']
        email = userDetails['email']
        cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
        cur.execute("select * from user where email_id = % s and password=% s ",(email,password))
        account = cur.fetchone()
        if account:
            session['loggedin'] = True
            session['id_number'] = account[3]
            session['email_id'] = account[0]
            session['hostel_no'] = account[4]
            return redirect('/homepage_student')
        else:
            cur.execute("select * from college_management where email_id = % s and password=% s",(email,password))
            account = cur.fetchone()
            if account:
                session['loggedin'] = True
                session['email_id'] = account[0]
                session['p_level'] = account[3]
                return redirect('/homepage_admin')
            else:                
                msg = 'Incorrect username / password !'

        return render_template('index.html')
        
    return render_template('index.html')
```
### Where clause 2:

-In cloth status page of student , where clause is used to only show the status of cloth of that particular user.

![Student Clothes status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84655836/226382238-bb2854db-a5be-4246-b253-e031a8108b11.jpeg)

        # Fetch form data
        clotheDetails = request.form
        today = date.today()
        cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO clothes (id_number, room_no, no_of_clothes, date, status) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)", (clotheDetails['id'], clotheDetails['room_no'], clotheDetails['no_of_clothes'], today, "Washing"))
        mysql.connection.commit()
